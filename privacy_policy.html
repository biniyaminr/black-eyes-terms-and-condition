        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how Black Eyes LLC

          This Privacy Policy applies to our Services that link to or reference
          this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites or
          applications maintained by third parties that we may link to or that

          If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, we will not be able to

          they are related, and our basis for such collection and processing is
          for legitimate interests we may have, such as to analyze and improve
          the Services as explained in more detail below. If you want to know
          how to exercise your rights to manage or delete the personal
          information we may have about you, please review “YOUR CHOICES” below.
        </p>
        <h2>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US WHEN USING OUR SERVICES.</h2>
        <p>
          Account Information. When you sign up to become a user of our
          Services, we collect personal information you choose to provide us,
          which may include your name, address, email, and phone number. We may
          also ask you for, or you may choose to provide, additional
          information, such as age or gender that will be associated with your
          Services account. All of this information that may identify, relate
          to, describe, reference, is reasonably capable of being associated
          with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a
          particular consumer, household, or device is called “Personal
          Information”. Personal information does not include: (a) Publicly
          available information from government records; (b) De-identified or
          aggregated consumer information; or (c) Information excluded from the
          California Consumer Protection Act, such as: (i) health or medical
          information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and
          Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality
          of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data; (ii)
          personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws,
          including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
          Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and
          the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994.
        </p>
        <p>
          User Content. We collect the content, communications and other
          information you provide when you use our Services, including when you
          sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or
          communicate with others (collectively, “User Content”). For example,
          we review the text and/or image content of your posts, replies, chat
          messages, and collect metadata regarding such messages that may
          collect the identity of the user and any users they communicate with.
          All posts of contents and replies are public and are publicly
          displayed (for information deleting content, please see “YOUR CHOICES”
          below). User Content may be viewed, shared and modified by our users,
          us and others for commercial or personal purposes (consistent with the
          rights and licenses in our Terms of Service). We collect information
          you choose to upload, sync or import from a device (such as an address
          book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like
          helping you and others find people you may know. Please keep in mind
          that if you include information that could identify you in any content
          you share or post, people who see it may determine your identity.
          MediaLab does not post chat messages publicly but, as with any message
          that you send via any service, the recipient might do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Purchase Transactions. If you make any purchases or engage in any
          other financial transactions through our Services, we collect
          information necessary to process the transaction. This includes
          payment information, such as your credit card or payment account
          information; authentication information; and billing, shipping and
          contact details.
        </p>

        <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN USING OUR SERVICES.</h2>
        <p>
          Location Information. Many features of the Services will not work
          unless you provide us with some information about your location. If
          you consent to the collection of location information (e.g. if you
          permit your mobile device to send us your latitude and longitude), we
          will collect and use this information both while you are directly
          using the Services and in the “background” (i.e. at times when you are
          not directly using the Services). For example, we or our advertising
          partners may show you content or posts from people around you or
          places you frequently visit, notifications of things happening around
          you in real time, or advertisements from businesses near your
          location. If you do not permit your mobile device to provide us with
          location information, or location information is not available from
          your device for technical reasons, we may use your IP address or
          information about the WiFi SSID from which you access the Services to
          determine an approximate geographic location for your device. For more
          details about how you may control the collection of location
          information, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usage Information. We collect information about your use of the
          Services, including access times, pages viewed, user and content
          interactions and other information about your interactions with our
          Services, as well as with other users, hashtags, and groups across our
          Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Device Information. We collect information from and about the devices
          and browsers you use that integrate with our Services. For example, we
          collect device type, which may include the hardware model, operating
          system and version, browser type and language, IP Address, plugins,
          app and file names and types, battery and signal strength, available
          storage space, unique device identifiers and mobile network
          information (which is treated as personal information in some
          jurisdictions, but which we use only to identify your geographic area
          and to comply with applicable laws), information you give us access to
          through device settings such as photos, camera, or GPS location,
          identifiers associate with cookies, web beacons or other technologies
          that may uniquely identify your device or browser. We may combine this
          information across different devices you use. For example, we use
          information collected about your use of our Services on your phone to
          better personalize the content (including ads) or features you see
          when you use our Services on another device, such as your laptop or
          tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad
          we showed you on your phone on a different device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. Like
          most websites and applications, we and our service providers use
          cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information.
          Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device
          memory that help us and our service providers to, among other things,
          improve our Services and your experience by seeing which areas and
          features of our Services are popular. Most web browsers are set to
          accept cookies by default. For more information about cookies and how
          to disable them, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below. Keep in mind that
          removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and
          functionality of some Services.

          provided whether or not you are logged in to a MediaLab Product at the

          We may share the information we have about you in the following ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          With Public or Others Using The Service. Any content, comments, or
          other communications posted to any of the Services is public and, as a
          result, can be seen by anyone, on or off our Services, including if

          displayed when you interact with the Services, such as when you post

          keep in mind that if your username contains your real name or is the
          same as how you identify yourself on other online services, people who
          see it may determine your identity.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

          Policy:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need
            access to such information to help us provide, protect, or maintain
            the Services;
          </li>
          <li>
            With measurement services to measure and optimize the performance of
            our Services, and to deliver more relevant ads, including for
            advertisers and other third-party websites and apps;
          </li>
          <li>
            With third parties offering goods and services for sale in our
            Services, who can receive your public information and additional
            information you provide them, including the information required to
            complete your transaction such as payment, shipping, and contact
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aggregated, non-personally identifiable, de-identified information
            (i.e. information about you and other users collectively, but not
            specifically identifiable to you) may be shared with third parties
            that provide services to us or perform business purposes for us to
            optimize advertisers’ and other third-parties’ ability to reach
            their target audience and markets;

          <li>
            With third party service providers helping us to enforce our
            policies if we suspect your actions are inconsistent with our user
            agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and
            safety of MediaLab or others, including to investigate, remedy, or
            enforce our Terms of Service;
          </li>
          <li>
            With law enforcement, government agencies, or in response to legal
            requests if we have a good faith belief that disclosing the
            information is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal
            process, or governmental request (e.g. subpoenas, court orders,
            government audits, etc.). This may include responding to requests
            from outside the US when we have a good faith belief a response is
            required and involves a user in that other jurisdiction;
          </li>
          <li>
            To help us detect or prevent fraud, which may include sharing
            device, usage, and other information we have about you;

          <li>
            In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of

            information about you among the various Services in order to provide
            you a more consistent and optimal experience and to enforce our
            policies.
          </li>
          <li>With your consent or at your direction.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND INTEGRATIONS</h2>
        <li>
          As noted above, our websites, webforms and mobile application will
          contain third-party content, links, and integrations. For example,
          when you use our Services you may be presented with content and links
          to an advertiser's website to learn more about their products and
          services. Through these integrations, you will be providing
          information to an advertiser, other third parties, as well as to us.
          We are not responsible for how an advertiser and such other third
          parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you
          to read the privacy policies of every advertiser and third-party
          service that you visit or use.
        </li>
        <h2>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
          How long we keep your information depends on the type of information,
          the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and other
          similar factors. For example, we keep your information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            That you submit through our Services (like your name, phone number,
            address, email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes
            outlined in this Privacy Policy (including for as long as need to
            provide you with our Services), unless a longer retention period is
            required or permitted by law.
          </li>
          <li>
            For as long as necessary to investigate and resolve disputes and/or
            enforce our rights and agreements, including if your account is
            disabled for violation of our policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Indefinitely if it is aggregated, anonymized, and de-identified
            (i.e., not capable of identifying you)
          </li>
          <li>
            In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of
            time or as required by applicable law.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you ever decide to stop using our Services, you can ask us to
          delete your information (see “YOUR CHOICES” to learn more). Keep in
          mind, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion
          automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur
          within a specific timeframe. Also, there may be legal requirements to
          keep and not delete your information when you make a deletion request
          to us. This means we may suspend deletion of or not delete your
          information if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve
          your information, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of
          Service violations, or if your use of our Services or your information
          is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of
          Service violations.
        </p>
        <h2>HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</h2>
        <p>
          The security of your personal information is very important, and we
          take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example, we have
          implemented technical and organizational security measures that are
          designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access,
          disclosure, use, and modification. We also maintain physical,
          electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed
          federal standards to guard your information, and we anonymize or
          expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide Services to our
          users or substantiate records for an advertiser. From time-to-time, we
          review our security procedures to consider appropriate new
          technologies and methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect,
          impenetrable, or 100% secure. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or
          guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain secure,
          nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed,
          disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner. These
          are the risks of being online and conducting business online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify
          you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
          We may also post a notice on our Services if a security breach occurs.
          Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a
          notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions
          about the security of your information, please contact us at:
          privacy@medialab.la.
        </p>
        <h2>YOUR CHOICES</h2>
        <p>
          We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you
          with the following tools to exercise control over the information we
          have about you. Keep in mind that each option is subject to applicable
          legal limitations. Additionally, because your privacy is important to
          us, we will ask you to verify your identity/request or provide
          additional information before we let you exercise your choices over
          the information we have about you. We may also reject your request for
          several reasons, including, by way of example only, if the request
          risks the privacy of other persons or is unlawful.

        <p>
          Your contents and posts remain public, if they were posted publicly,
          so long as you or we do not delete them from the Services. You may
          choose to delete your individual posts or contents at any time and we

          note that your deleted posts or contents may remain in storage in our

          copy or save them. Search engines and other sites may also index and
          cache content on our Services. You may have to contact these

        <h2>OPTING OUT OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES.</h2>
        <p>
          Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default but also give
          you the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online
          tracking technologies. To opt-out of the use of these technologies,
          you can usually change your browser options to stop accepting cookies
          or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Keep in mind that not all
          devices and browsers are the same so the methods for disabling cookies
          on one browser may not be the same for different browsers or devices
          and may change at any time. Opting out of cookies and other tracking
          technologies may not preclude advertising networks from which you have
          not opted out from displaying customized advertising. In addition,
          opting out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying
          advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and,
          consequently, may be less relevant to you. You will need to make these
          choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you elect to opt-out of cookies for a particular Service, an
          opt-out cookie is placed on your device. Then when you visit the same
          Service, the opt-out cookie tells the Service you opted out. This
          means that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could
          affect the availability and functionality of our Services, including
          preventing your consent choices from being stored. As a result, we may
          not know about, or be able to honor, your election to opt-out. We
          encourage you to refer to the relevant instructions for your
          particular device or browser to learn how to manage cookies and other
          tracking technologies. For more information on how to disable cookies
          on the most common browsers, we’ve assembled the following information

        <h2>EUROPEAN VISITORS – COOKIES NOTICE.</h2>
        <p>
          In connection with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
          applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK-GDPR
          applicable in the UK, we eliminate or limit the use of cookies and
          similar technologies with visitors from the EEA and the UK (excluding
          our corporate website available at http://medialab.la, which continues
          to use cookies for all users with proper consent as explained below).
          Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you visit a third-party site that uses our Services, we will not
            place any cookies on your device unless you have provided your
            consent and been provided with notice of our privacy practices and
            your ability to opt-out at any time. We will not seek your consent
            to use cookies in this instance, though the advertiser or their
            website publisher may do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you visit one of our Services, we will only place limited
            third-party cookies, such as those made available for analytics
            purposes by Google and Bing. In this case, we will seek your consent
            to use these third-party cookies and will only do so after you
            indicate your consent. If you do not consent, then no cookies will
            be written to your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are visiting our corporate website, http://medialab.la, for
            the first time, or the first time after we make a material change,
            we will seek your consent to use cookies.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you do not consent, you will still be able to use our Services,
            but certain functionality may be limited. To enable this feature, we
            use third-party tools to determine your geographic location; if
            these tools indicate that you are in the EEA, then we treat your
            visit as above. If you feel that you are subject to GDPR, but we
            have nonetheless used cookies in connection with your visit without
            consent (which may be due to a failure of the third party
            geolocation tools, your use of a proxy server, your location outside
            of the EEA at the time of your visit, or some other factor beyond
            our control) please notify us through our email,
            privacy@medialab.la, and make sure to include any relevant details
            so that we can ensure proper treatment of your data under GDPR.

        <p>
          MediaLab is based in the United States and the information we collect

          are performed only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy
          and are necessary to provide the Services to you globally. We utilize
          standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission’s adequacy
          decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your
          consent for these data transfers to the United States. For EEA

          request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will
          only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer
          request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the
          request. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to
          create an account with us.

          Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Response timing and format. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable
          consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we
          require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason
          and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we
          will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have
          an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or
          electronically, at your option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
          preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we
          provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request,
          if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
          to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should
          allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another
          entity without hindrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
          consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
          unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will
          tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
          estimate before completing your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-Discrimination. We will not discriminate against any California
          resident for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by
          the CCPA, we will not:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deny you goods or services;</li>
          <li>
            Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services,
            including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing
            penalties;
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services;
          </li>
          <li>
            Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or
            services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by
          the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality
          levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will
          reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain
          written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.
          Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt
          in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

        <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION SALES OPT-OUT AND OPT-IN RIGHTS.</h2>
        <p>
          Under California law, if you are 16 years of age or older, you have
          the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any
          time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information
          of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we
          receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either
          the consumer who is at least 13 but not yet 16 years of age, or the
          parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers
          who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales
          at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized
          representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the “ Do Not
          Sell My Personal Information” Section of our website. Once you make an
          opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before
          asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may
          change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any
          time by: Accessing ‘Personal Data Consent' in ‘Settings’ on applicable
          Product being used.
        </p>
        <p>
          You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out
          rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out
          request to review and comply with the request.
        </p>

          our Services from residents of the United States. The data protection
          and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as
          those in your country. Where permitted by applicable law, we may
          transfer the personal data we collect about you to other jurisdictions
          other than where you reside that may not be deemed to provide the same
          level of data protection as your home country for the purposes set out
          in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>

          Policy, regardless of the laws of your country of residence.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent the laws of another jurisdiction apply to your data or

          under the EU General Data Protection Regulation or the UK-GDPR
          (collectively, the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as
          outlined below. For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and
          “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data”
          generally means information that can be used to individually identify
          a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be
          performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and
          disclosure. We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed
          in connection with the Services. Note that we may also process
          Personal Data of our customers’ end users in connection with our
          provision of certain Services, in which case we are the processor of
          Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e.,
          not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first
          instance to address your rights with respect to such data. If there
          are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this
          Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of
          Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you

        <p>
          User Content. We collect the content, communications and other
          information you provide when you use our Services, including when you
          sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or
          communicate with others (collectively, “User Content”). For example,
          we review the text and/or image content of your posts, replies, chat
          messages, and collect metadata regarding such messages that may
          collect the identity of the user and any users they communicate with.
          All posts of contents and replies are public and are publicly
          displayed (for information deleting content, please see “YOUR CHOICES”
          below). User Content may be viewed, shared and modified by our users,
          us and others for commercial or personal purposes (consistent with the
          rights and licenses in our Terms of Service). We collect information
          you choose to upload, sync or import from a device (such as an address
          book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like
          helping you and others find people you may know. Please keep in mind
          that if you include information that could identify you in any content
          you share or post, people who see it may determine your identity.

          that you send via any service, the recipient might do so.

        <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN USING OUR SERVICES.</h2>
        <p>
          Location Information. Many features of the Services will not work
          unless you provide us with some information about your location. If
          you consent to the collection of location information (e.g. if you
          permit your mobile device to send us your latitude and longitude), we
          will collect and use this information both while you are directly
          using the Services and in the “background” (i.e. at times when you are
          not directly using the Services). For example, we or our advertising
          partners may show you content or posts from people around you or
          places you frequently visit, notifications of things happening around
          you in real time, or advertisements from businesses near your
          location. If you do not permit your mobile device to provide us with
          location information, or location information is not available from
          your device for technical reasons, we may use your IP address or
          information about the WiFi SSID from which you access the Services to
          determine an approximate geographic location for your device. For more
          details about how you may control the collection of location

          Services.

        <p>
          Device Information. We collect information from and about the devices
          and browsers you use that integrate with our Services. For example, we

        </ul>
        <h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
          We may share the information we have about you in the following ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          With Public or Others Using The Service. Any content, comments, or
          other communications posted to any of the Services is public and, as a
          result, can be seen by anyone, on or off our Services, including if
          they don’t have an account. This includes your username at the time
          the content was posted, the text and image contents of your post and
          the geographic location in which you posted your post or content. For
          some of our Services, a username will be randomly assigned to you that
          you may change or delete at any time. Your username is publicly
          displayed when you interact with the Services, such as when you post
          information or content or send a chat message to another user. Please
          keep in mind that if your username contains your real name or is the
          same as how you identify yourself on other online services, people who
          see it may determine your identity.
        </p>
        <li>
          It is possible for public content to be accessed, downloaded, or
          shared through third-party services such as search engines, APIs,
          apps, websites, and by other services that integrate with our
          Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you use any chat messaging function to directly contact another
          user, the recipient of your chat message will see your username and
          the contents of your message. The recipient may also choose to
          disclose your chat messages to others.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you post any User Content to the Services, other users may be able
          to see certain information related to your location. For example,
          other users may be able to see whether you are or were within a
          certain proximity of their current location or if you frequent similar
          locations.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you invite others to try our Services via SMS, email or otherwise,
          those individuals may see your name, phone number, email address or
          other contact information.
        </li>
        <li>
          For some of our Services, people can see signals telling them whether
          you are active on our Services, including whether you are currently
          active or when you last used our Services.
        </li>
        <p>
          With Social Sharing Services. The Services may offer social sharing
          features and other integrated tools, which let you share posts with
          other media. Your use of such features enables the sharing of
          information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings
          you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing
          feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data
          collection and processing in connection with social sharing features,
          please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these
          features.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Advertisers. To perform analytics and deliver relevant content
          and advertising, we may allow others to collect information about how
          you use our Services. For example, these entities may use cookies,
          device identifiers and similar technologies to collect information
          about your computer or device, the content that interests you, the
          places you visit, and the time you spend using different parts of our
          Services.
        </p>

            their target audience and markets;
          </li>
          <li>
            With third party service providers helping us to enforce our
            policies if we suspect your actions are inconsistent with our user
            agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and
            safety of MediaLab or others, including to investigate, remedy, or
            enforce our Terms of Service;
          </li>
          <li>
            With law enforcement, government agencies, or in response to legal
            requests if we have a good faith belief that disclosing the
            information is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal
            process, or governmental request (e.g. subpoenas, court orders,
            government audits, etc.). This may include responding to requests
            from outside the US when we have a good faith belief a response is
            required and involves a user in that other jurisdiction;
          </li>
          <li>
            To help us detect or prevent fraud, which may include sharing
            device, usage, and other information we have about you;
          </li>
          <li>
            In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of
            company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our
            business by another company;
          </li>
          <li>
            Between and among MediaLab, and its current and future parents,
            affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control
            and ownership, as permitted by applicable law, we may share
            information about you among the various Services in order to provide
            you a more consistent and optimal experience and to enforce our
            policies.
          </li>
          <li>With your consent or at your direction.</li>

        <h2>THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND INTEGRATIONS</h2>
        <p>
          As noted above, our websites, webforms and mobile application will
          contain third-party content, links, and integrations. For example,
          when you use our Services you may be presented with content and links
          to an advertiser's website to learn more about their products and
          services. Through these integrations, you will be providing
          information to an advertiser, other third parties, as well as to us.
          We are not responsible for how an advertiser and such other third
          parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you
          to read the privacy policies of every advertiser and third-party
          service that you visit or use.
        </p>
        <h2>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
          How long we keep your information depends on the type of information,
          the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and other
          similar factors. For example, we keep your information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            That you submit through our Services (like your name, phone number,
            address, email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes
            outlined in this Privacy Policy (including for as long as need to
            provide you with our Services), unless a longer retention period is
            required or permitted by law.
          </li>
          <li>
            For as long as necessary to investigate and resolve disputes and/or
            enforce our rights and agreements, including if your account is
            disabled for violation of our policies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Indefinitely if it is aggregated, anonymized, and de-identified
            (i.e., not capable of identifying you).
          </li>
          <li>
            In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of
            time or as required by applicable law.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you ever decide to stop using our Services, you can ask us to
          delete your information (see “YOUR CHOICES” to learn more). Keep in
          mind, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion
          automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur
          within a specific timeframe. Also, there may be legal requirements to
          keep and not delete your information when you make a deletion request
          to us. This means we may suspend deletion of or not delete your
          information if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve
          your information, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of
          Service violations, or if your use of our Services or your information
          is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of
          Service violations.
        </p>
        <h2>HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</h2>
        <p>
          The security of your personal information is very important, and we
          take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example, we have
          implemented technical and organizational security measures that are
          designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access,
          disclosure, use, and modification. We also maintain physical,
          electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed
          federal standards to guard your information, and we anonymize or
          expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide Services to our
          users or substantiate records for an advertiser. From time-to-time, we
          review our security procedures to consider appropriate new
          technologies and methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect,
          impenetrable, or 100% secure. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or
          guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain secure,
          nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed,
          disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner. These
          are the risks of being online and conducting business online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify
          you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
          We may also post a notice on our Services if a security breach occurs.
          Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a
          notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions
          about the security of your information, please contact us at:
          privacy@medialab.la.
        </p>
        <h2>YOUR CHOICES</h2>
        <p>
          We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you
          with the following tools to exercise control over the information we
          have about you. Keep in mind that each option is subject to applicable
          legal limitations. Additionally, because your privacy is important to
          us, we will ask you to verify your identity/request or provide
          additional information before we let you exercise your choices over
          the information we have about you. We may also reject your request for
          several reasons, including, by way of example only, if the request
          risks the privacy of other persons or is unlawful.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Access and Portability. You can access and receive a copy of the

        <h2>DELETING ACCOUNT INFORMATION.</h2>
        <p>
          Your contents and posts remain public, if they were posted publicly,
          so long as you or we do not delete them from the Services. You may
          choose to delete your individual posts or contents at any time and we
          will then remove them from the Services. However, it is important to
          note that your deleted posts or contents may remain in storage in our
          systems for a limited period of time for legal, business, safety, or
          system backup reasons, and they may remain accessible in cached and
          archived pages of the Services or elsewhere if others have chosen to
          copy or save them. Search engines and other sites may also index and
          cache content on our Services. You may have to contact these
          third-party sites or search engines directly to delete your cached
          information, subject to their policies and procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to delete your account, please contact us by using the
          “Email Support” link in settings from inside the applicable Product,
          or by emailing us at: support@medialab.la. Remember that information
          that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will
          not be deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          As explained above, even after a deletion request, we may retain
          certain information as required by law, for legitimate business
          purposes, or for the safety of MediaLab (including its users) and
          others. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information
          about you for a certain limited period of time.
        </p>
        <h2>DELETING LOCATION INFORMATION.</h2>
        <p>
          When you first download or open any of our mobile application Services
          or access certain features of the Services, you will be asked to
          consent to the collection of location information from your mobile
          device or platform. If you consent to the collection of this
          information but later wish to withdraw your consent, you may do so at
          any time by either changing the settings on your mobile device or
          deleting our mobile application Services from your device.
        </p>
        <h2>OPTING OUT OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES.</h2>
        <p>
          Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default but also give
          you the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online
          tracking technologies. To opt-out of the use of these technologies,
          you can usually change your browser options to stop accepting cookies
          or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Keep in mind that not all
          devices and browsers are the same so the methods for disabling cookies
          on one browser may not be the same for different browsers or devices
          and may change at any time. Opting out of cookies and other tracking
          technologies may not preclude advertising networks from which you have
          not opted out from displaying customized advertising. In addition,
          opting out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying
          advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and,
          consequently, may be less relevant to you. You will need to make these
          choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you elect to opt-out of cookies for a particular Service, an
          opt-out cookie is placed on your device. Then when you visit the same
          Service, the opt-out cookie tells the Service you opted out. This
          means that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could
          affect the availability and functionality of our Services, including
          preventing your consent choices from being stored. As a result, we may
          not know about, or be able to honor, your election to opt-out. We
          encourage you to refer to the relevant instructions for your
          particular device or browser to learn how to manage cookies and other
          tracking technologies. For more information on how to disable cookies
          on the most common browsers, we’ve assembled the following information
          for you below:

          Other Options for Disabling Online Tracking. Blocking cookies in your
          browser may not prevent cross-site tracking of your online activity
          using other online tracking technologies. In addition to managing your
          cookie settings for your browser, you can opt-out of tracking directly
          with the businesses that operate the tracking technologies. To opt-out
          of certain analytic tracking by our service providers visit the links

            Do Not Track. Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals
            (go here to learn more). Web browsers may incorporate or activate
            these features differently, making it unclear if users have
            consciously activated them. As a result, we do not take steps to
            respond to such signals.

        <h2>EUROPEAN VISITORS – COOKIES NOTICE.</h2>
        <p>
          In connection with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
          applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK-GDPR
          applicable in the UK, we eliminate or limit the use of cookies and
          similar technologies with visitors from the EEA and the UK (excluding
          our corporate website available at http://medialab.la, which continues
          to use cookies for all users with proper consent as explained below).
          Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you visit a third-party site that uses our Services, we will not
            place any cookies on your device unless you have provided your
            consent and been provided with notice of our privacy practices and
            your ability to opt-out at any time. We will not seek your consent
            to use cookies in this instance, though the advertiser or their
            website publisher may do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you visit one of our Services, we will only place limited
            third-party cookies, such as those made available for analytics
            purposes by Google and Bing. In this case, we will seek your consent
            to use these third-party cookies and will only do so after you
            indicate your consent. If you do not consent, then no cookies will
            be written to your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are visiting our corporate website, http://medialab.la, for
            the first time, or the first time after we make a material change,
            we will seek your consent to use cookies.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you do not consent, you will still be able to use our Services,
            but certain functionality may be limited. To enable this feature, we
            use third-party tools to determine your geographic location; if
            these tools indicate that you are in the EEA, then we treat your
            visit as above. If you feel that you are subject to GDPR, but we
            have nonetheless used cookies in connection with your visit without
            consent (which may be due to a failure of the third party
            geolocation tools, your use of a proxy server, your location outside
            of the EEA at the time of your visit, or some other factor beyond
            our control) please notify us through our email,
            privacy@medialab.la, and make sure to include any relevant details
            so that we can ensure proper treatment of your data under GDPR.

        <h2>WHERE INFORMATION IS PROCESSED & STORED</h2>
        <p>
          MediaLab is based in the United States and the information we collect
          is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using the Services or
          otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing
          and transfer of information in and to the U.S. These data transfers
          are performed only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy
          and are necessary to provide the Services to you globally. We utilize
          standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission’s adequacy
          decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your
          consent for these data transfers to the United States. For EEA
          visitors, please read the “EUROPEAN VISITORS – COOKIES NOTICE.”

            <p>Deletion Request Rights. California residents have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. To exercise this right, please see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights below. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request meets the requirements explained in the section Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
            <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>

            </ul>
            <h2>EXERCISING ACCESS, DATA PORTABILITY, AND DELETION RIGHTS.</h2>
            <p>Make a verifiable consumer request. To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either completing our Data Access & Erasure Form or by emailing us at: privacy@medialab.la. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or are an authorized representative; and</li>
                <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
            <p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</p>
            <p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</p>
            <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
            <p>Non-Discrimination. We will not discriminate against any California resident for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deny you goods or services;</li>
                <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;</li>
                <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services;</li>
                <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
            <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION SALES OPT-OUT AND OPT-IN RIGHTS.</h2>
            <p>Under California law, if you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is at least 13 but not yet 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>
            <p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the “ Do Not Sell My Personal Information” Section of our website. Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by: Accessing ‘Personal Data Consent' in ‘Settings’ on applicable Product being used.</p>
            <p>You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>
            <p>Other California Privacy Rights. California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Requests can be made no more than once per calendar year. To make such a request, please contact us at the email or address below and specify “Shine the Light Request.” We will respond to your request within thirty (30) days of receiving it.</p>

            <h2>NEVADA RESIDENTS</h2>
            <p>Subject to certain exceptions, some of our data sharing practices may be considered a “sale” of your personal information under Nevada Revised Statutes 603A. Nevada residents may opt-out of the “sale” of personal information covered under the statute, by exercising your cookie consent options as detailed in Cookies and Other Technologies or by emailing your request to privacy@medialab.la.</p>
            <h2>VISITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our Services from residents of the United States. The data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Where permitted by applicable law, we may transfer the personal data we collect about you to other jurisdictions other than where you reside that may not be deemed to provide the same level of data protection as your home country for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>By visiting or using our Services in any way, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy, regardless of the laws of your country of residence.</p>
            <p>To the extent the laws of another jurisdiction apply to your data or use of our Services, we will comply with such laws. For example, for European Visitors, read the “EUROPEAN VISITORS – COOKIES NOTICE.” section of Cookies and Other Technologies to learn more about our use of cookies and similar technologies with visitors from the EEA.</p>
            <h2>EU Visitors</h2>
            <p>If you are an EU citizen or UK citizen, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation or the UK-GDPR (collectively, the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below. For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers’ end users in connection with our provision of certain Services, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at : privacy@medialab.la.</p>
            <p>The legal bases for which we collect and use the information described above depends on what the information is and why we collected it. The four bases upon which we rely include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contract. This means we need the information to perform our contracted Services with you. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require that data.</li>
                <li>Legitimate Interests. This means we have a legitimate interest that does not outweigh your privacy rights. When we collect and process information based on our legitimate interests, we consider how we can accomplish what we need to in a way that is the least obtrusive on your privacy. For example, it is in our interest to protect your safety and security in the Services, so we collect and use information that has been flagged by users or requested by law enforcement; to make sure you are satisfied with how the services work, troubleshoot technical problems or develop new features, we collect and use information about how you and others use the services and to respond to your service inquiries, we collect and use information in that request and, if relevant to the inquiry, information about how you access and use the services.</li>
                <li>Legal Obligation. We may need to use your personal information to comply with a law enforcement preservation request, subpoena, or other legal process or to protect the rights of other users.</li>
                <li>Consent. If we have no other legal basis for collecting or using your information, we will ask you for consent for a specific purpose. If we do, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not apply to any processing conducted in reliance on lawful processing bases other than consent.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>In addition to other rights detailed in the policy (such as requesting deletion, correction or updating of your personal information), EU and UK citizens have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Right to Object or Restrict Processing. You have the right to object to or restrict our use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes or under certain circumstances when the legal bases for using your information is based upon our legitimate interest. If you wish to object to our use of your information, you can send us a request to delete your account by sending an email to: privacy@medialab.la.</li>
                <li>Right to Access or Erasure. You have the right to have your personal data erased and no longer processed. You also have the right to access the Personal Data we have collected about you. You can send us a request to delete your account or access your information by completing our Data Access & Erasure Form or by sending an email to: privacy@medialab.la. Upon receiving the request, we will make a reasonable effort to delete your personal information from the Service and from our internal network within a reasonable period of time as long as we are not obligated to preserve your information due to things like law enforcement preservation requests, subpoenas, investigations, litigation, or otherwise meet any of our other legal obligations. We may also retain depersonalized information after deletion.</li>
                <li>Withdrawal of Consent. If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of the Services. You can exercise your right to withdraw consent by completing our by sending us an email to: privacy@medialab.la.</li>
                <li>Data Portability. You can exercise your right to export your personal data by completing our Data Access & Erasure Form or by sending us an email to: privacy@medialab.la.</li>
                <li>File a Complaint. You have the right to complain to the data protection authority located in your Member State. To find contact details, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm">click here</a> .</li>

            </ul>
            <p>As explained above, personal data collected in the EU or UK may be transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside of the EU and/or UK and processed by employees operating outside of the EU and/or UK who work for us, one of our business partners, or service providers. We have implemented sufficient GDPR compliant procedures to secure the transfer of your personal data to the United States. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States.</p>
            <h2>CHILDREN’S INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 16 in countries subject to the EU GDPR, unless exempted by individual country exceptions.</p>
            <p>If you are under 13, or 16 where applicable, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the required minimum age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under the required minimum age may have provided us personal information, please contact us at: privacy@medialab.la.</p>
            <h2>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice to our Services and will update the notice’s effective date. We will give you an opportunity to review the changes before they go into effect. Your continued use of the Services following notice of the changes constitutes your acceptance of the changes, so we encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use our services. If you do not agree to the updated Privacy Policy, you may delete your account(s).</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how MediaLab.Ai (“MediaLab” or “we” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our website (“Website”), or other products or features we offer, including the following: Whisper; Kik; Datpiff; Worldstar; Amino; Coco; Manga and any other features, apps, technologies, software, products, or services offered by MediaLab (collectively with Website, the “Services”).

            <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
            <p>To provide you the Services, we collect the categories of information described below.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Most of the data collection and uses described in this Privacy Policy are necessary in order for us to be able to provide you the Services. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, we will not be able to provide you usage of the Services. Some of the data collection and uses are not strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but they are related, and our basis for such collection and processing is for legitimate interests we may have, such as to analyze and improve the Services as explained in more detail below. If you want to know how to exercise your rights to manage or delete the personal information we may have about you, please review “YOUR CHOICES” below.</p>
            <h2>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US WHEN USING OUR SERVICES.</h2>

            <p>Your Purchase Transactions. If you make any purchases or engage in any other financial transactions through our Services, we collect information necessary to process the transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit card or payment account information; authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.</p>
            <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN USING OUR SERVICES.</h2>
            <p>Location Information. Many features of the Services will not work unless you provide us with some information about your location. If you consent to the collection of location information (e.g. if you permit your mobile device to send us your latitude and longitude), we will collect and use this information both while you are directly using the Services and in the “background” (i.e. at times when you are not directly using the Services). For example, we or our advertising partners may show you content or posts from people around you or places you frequently visit, notifications of things happening around you in real time, or advertisements from businesses near your location. If you do not permit your mobile device to provide us with location information, or location information is not available from your device for technical reasons, we may use your IP address or information about the WiFi SSID from which you access the Services to determine an approximate geographic location for your device. For more details about how you may control the collection of location information, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below.</p>
            <p>Usage Information. We collect information about your use of the Services, including access times, pages viewed, user and content interactions and other information about your interactions with our Services, as well as with other users, hashtags, and groups across our Services.</p>
            <p>Device Information. We collect information from and about the devices and browsers you use that integrate with our Services. For example, we collect device type, which may include the hardware model, operating system and version, browser type and language, IP Address, plugins, app and file names and types, battery and signal strength, available storage space, unique device identifiers and mobile network information (which is treated as personal information in some jurisdictions, but which we use only to identify your geographic area and to comply with applicable laws), information you give us access to through device settings such as photos, camera, or GPS location, identifiers associate with cookies, web beacons or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser. We may combine this information across different devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Services on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Services on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different device.</p>
            <p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. Like most websites and applications, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us and our service providers to, among other things, improve our Services and your experience by seeing which areas and features of our Services are popular. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see “YOUR CHOICES” below. Keep in mind that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of some Services.</p>
            <h2>INFORMATION WE GET FROM ADVERTISERS, THIRD PARTIES, AND OFFLINE SOURCES.</h2>
            <p>We may receive information about you from advertisers, app developers, and publishers, or other online or offline sources with whom you interact and who have the rights to provide us with your information. For example, advertisers, publishers, and other third parties may share how you interact with their ads, websites, or apps, how you use their services, or what purchases you make. This information may be provided whether or not you are logged in to a MediaLab Product at the time. We may combine such information with the information you have provided to us in order to provide and improve our Services. We require each of these advertisers, publishers, or other third parties to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.</p>
            <h2>ANY OTHER INFORMATION YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE TO US.</h2>
            <p>You may provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, update your account, interact with the Services, apply for a job at our company, communicate with us via third-party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.</p>
            <h2>COLLECTION AND USE OF SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA.</h2>

            <h2>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>We may share the information we have about you in the following ways:</p>
            <p>With Public or Others Using The Service. Any content, comments, or other communications posted to any of the Services is public and, as a result, can be seen by anyone, on or off our Services, including if they don’t have an account. This includes your username at the time the content was posted, the text and image contents of your post and the geographic location in which you posted your post or content. For some of our Services, a username will be randomly assigned to you that you may change or delete at any time. Your username is publicly displayed when you interact with the Services, such as when you post information or content or send a chat message to another user. Please keep in mind that if your username contains your real name or is the same as how you identify yourself on other online services, people who see it may determine your identity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is possible for public content to be accessed, downloaded, or shared through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, apps, websites, and by other services that integrate with our Services.</li>
                <li>When you use any chat messaging function to directly contact another user, the recipient of your chat message will see your username and the contents of your message. The recipient may also choose to disclose your chat messages to others.</li>
                <li>If you post any User Content to the Services, other users may be able to see certain information related to your location. For example, other users may be able to see whether you are or were within a certain proximity of their current location or if you frequent similar locations.</li>
                <li>If you invite others to try our Services via SMS, email or otherwise, those individuals may see your name, phone number, email address or other contact information.</li>
                <li>For some of our Services, people can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Services, including whether you are currently active or when you last used our Services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With Social Sharing Services. The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools, which let you share posts with other media. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.</p>
            <p>With Advertisers. To perform analytics and deliver relevant content and advertising, we may allow others to collect information about how you use our Services. For example, these entities may use cookies, device identifiers and similar technologies to collect information about your computer or device, the content that interests you, the places you visit, and the time you spend using different parts of our Services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For more information about online advertising, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used by participating companies for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page , the Trust Arc Preference Manager , the Google Ad Settings Page and the Facebook Ad Choices Page. Your mobile device also may include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through our mobile application used for behavioral advertising purposes.</li>

                <li>Aggregated, non-personally identifiable, de-identified information (i.e. information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) may be shared with third parties that provide services to us or perform business purposes for us to optimize advertisers’ and other third-parties’ ability to reach their target audience and markets;</li>

                <li>Between and among MediaLab, and its current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership, as permitted by applicable law, we may share information about you among the various Services in order to provide you a more consistent and optimal experience and to enforce our policies.</li>
                <li>With your consent or at your direction.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND INTEGRATIONS</h2>
            <p>As noted above, our websites, webforms and mobile application will contain third-party content, links, and integrations. For example, when you use our Services you may be presented with content and links to an advertiser's website to learn more about their products and services. Through these integrations, you will be providing information to an advertiser, other third parties, as well as to us. We are not responsible for how an advertiser and such other third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to read the privacy policies of every advertiser and third-party service that you visit or use.</p>
            <h2>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>How long we keep your information depends on the type of information, the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and other similar factors. For example, we keep your information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>That you submit through our Services (like your name, phone number, address, email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it.</li>
                <li>For the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (including for as long as need to provide you with our Services), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</li>
                <li>For as long as necessary to investigate and resolve disputes and/or enforce our rights and agreements, including if your account is disabled for violation of our policies.</li>
                <li>Indefinitely if it is aggregated, anonymized, and de-identified (i.e., not capable of identifying you).</li>
                <li>In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of time or as required by applicable law.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>If you ever decide to stop using our Services, you can ask us to delete your information (see “YOUR CHOICES” to learn more). Keep in mind, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. Also, there may be legal requirements to keep and not delete your information when you make a deletion request to us. This means we may suspend deletion of or not delete your information if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve your information, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your use of our Services or your information is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations.</p>
            <h2>HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</h2>
            <p>The security of your personal information is very important, and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example, we have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to guard your information, and we anonymize or expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide Services to our users or substantiate records for an advertiser. From time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.</p>
            <p>Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect, impenetrable, or 100% secure. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner. These are the risks of being online and conducting business online.</p>
            <p>Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on our Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions about the security of your information, please contact us at: privacy@medialab.la.</p>
            <h2>YOUR CHOICES</h2>
            <p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools to exercise control over the information we have about you. Keep in mind that each option is subject to applicable legal limitations. Additionally, because your privacy is important to us, we will ask you to verify your identity/request or provide additional information before we let you exercise your choices over the information we have about you. We may also reject your request for several reasons, including, by way of example only, if the request risks the privacy of other persons or is unlawful.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access and Portability. You can access and receive a copy of the information we have about you by emailing privacy@medialab.la and requesting “Access My Information.”</li>

If you wish to unsubscribe or change/update any communication preferences with us including calls or mail, email privacy@medialab.la and request “Marketing and Communication Preferences”. Please note that we only control our own mailing and marketing lists/subscriptions and policies. Third parties that maintain their own marketing lists may send communications that advertise our Services. You must contact these parties directly in order to stop receiving their communications.</li>
                <li>Cookies and other Tracking Technologies. To learn more about your choices and how to exercise control over the information we collect from you automatically using cookies and other online tracking technologies, read Cookies and Other Technologies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have any questions or need assistance email us at privacy@medialab.la.</p>
            <h2>DELETING ACCOUNT INFORMATION.</h2>
            <p>Your contents and posts remain public, if they were posted publicly, so long as you or we do not delete them from the Services. You may choose to delete your individual posts or contents at any time and we will then remove them from the Services. However, it is important to note that your deleted posts or contents may remain in storage in our systems for a limited period of time for legal, business, safety, or system backup reasons, and they may remain accessible in cached and archived pages of the Services or elsewhere if others have chosen to copy or save them. Search engines and other sites may also index and cache content on our Services. You may have to contact these third-party sites or search engines directly to delete your cached information, subject to their policies and procedures.</p>
            <p>If you wish to delete your account, please contact us by using the “Email Support” link in settings from inside the applicable Product, or by emailing us at: support@medialab.la. Remember that information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted.</p>
            <p>As explained above, even after a deletion request, we may retain certain information as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or for the safety of MediaLab (including its users) and others. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain limited period of time.</p>
            <h2>DELETING LOCATION INFORMATION.</h2>
            <p>When you first download or open any of our mobile application Services or access certain features of the Services, you will be asked to consent to the collection of location information from your mobile device or platform. If you consent to the collection of this information but later wish to withdraw your consent, you may do so at any time by either changing the settings on your mobile device or deleting our mobile application Services from your device.</p>
            <h2>OPTING OUT OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES.</h2>
            <p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default but also give you the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online tracking technologies. To opt-out of the use of these technologies, you can usually change your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Keep in mind that not all devices and browsers are the same so the methods for disabling cookies on one browser may not be the same for different browsers or devices and may change at any time. Opting out of cookies and other tracking technologies may not preclude advertising networks from which you have not opted out from displaying customized advertising. In addition, opting out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you. You will need to make these choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our Services.</p>
            <p>When you elect to opt-out of cookies for a particular Service, an opt-out cookie is placed on your device. Then when you visit the same Service, the opt-out cookie tells the Service you opted out. This means that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services, including preventing your consent choices from being stored. As a result, we may not know about, or be able to honor, your election to opt-out. We encourage you to refer to the relevant instructions for your particular device or browser to learn how to manage cookies and other tracking technologies. For more information on how to disable cookies on the most common browsers, we’ve assembled the following information for you below:</p>

                <h2>EUROPEAN VISITORS – COOKIES NOTICE.</h2>
                <p>In connection with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK-GDPR applicable in the UK, we eliminate or limit the use of cookies and similar technologies with visitors from the EEA and the UK (excluding our corporate website available at http://medialab.la, which continues to use cookies for all users with proper consent as explained below). Specifically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you visit a third-party site that uses our Services, we will not place any cookies on your device unless you have provided your consent and been provided with notice of our privacy practices and your ability to opt-out at any time. We will not seek your consent to use cookies in this instance, though the advertiser or their website publisher may do so.</li>
                    <li>If you visit one of our Services, we will only place limited third-party cookies, such as those made available for analytics purposes by Google and Bing. In this case, we will seek your consent to use these third-party cookies and will only do so after you indicate your consent. If you do not consent, then no cookies will be written to your device.</li>
                    <li>If you are visiting our corporate website, http://medialab.la, for the first time, or the first time after we make a material change, we will seek your consent to use cookies.</li>
                    <li>If you do not consent, you will still be able to use our Services, but certain functionality may be limited. To enable this feature, we use third-party tools to determine your geographic location; if these tools indicate that you are in the EEA, then we treat your visit as above. If you feel that you are subject to GDPR, but we have nonetheless used cookies in connection with your visit without consent (which may be due to a failure of the third party geolocation tools, your use of a proxy server, your location outside of the EEA at the time of your visit, or some other factor beyond our control) please notify us through our email, privacy@medialab.la, and make sure to include any relevant details so that we can ensure proper treatment of your data under GDPR.</li>

                </ul>

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request meets the requirements explained in the section “Exercising Access, Data Portability, And Deletion Rights.,” we will provide the requested information. Keep in mind, if we do not have information that permits us to verify your identity, we may deny your request to access data.</p>
                   <p>Deletion Request Rights. California residents have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. To exercise this right, please see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights below.

                   <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>

                <h2>EXERCISING ACCESS, DATA PORTABILITY, AND DELETION RIGHTS.</h2>
                <p>Make a verifiable consumer request. To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either completing our Data Access & Erasure Form or by emailing us at: privacy@medialab.la. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or are an authorized representative; and</li>
                    <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
                <p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</p>
                <p>Response timing and format. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
                <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
                <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
                <p>Non-Discrimination. We will not discriminate against any California resident for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deny you goods or services;</li>
                    <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;</li>
                    <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services;</li>
                    <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
                <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION SALES OPT-OUT AND OPT-IN RIGHTS.</h2>
                <p>Under California law, if you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is at least 13 but not yet 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>
                <p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the “ Do Not Sell My Personal Information” Section of our website. Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by: Accessing ‘Personal Data Consent' in ‘Settings’ on applicable Product being used.</p>
                <p>You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>
                <p>Other California Privacy Rights. California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Requests can be made no more than once per calendar year. To make such a request, please contact us at the email or address below and specify “Shine the Light Request.” We will respond to your request within thirty (30) days of receiving it.</p>

Nevada residents may opt-out of the “sale” of personal information covered under the statute, by exercising your cookie consent options as detailed in Cookies and Other Technologies or by emailing your request to privacy@medialab.la.</p>
                <h2>VISITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our Services from residents of the United States. The data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Where permitted by applicable law, we may transfer the personal data we collect about you to other jurisdictions other than where you reside that may not be deemed to provide the same level of data protection as your home country for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>By visiting or using our Services in any way, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy, regardless of the laws of your country of residence.</p>
                <p>To the extent the laws of another jurisdiction apply to your data or use of our Services, we will comply with such laws. For example, for European Visitors, read the “EUROPEAN VISITORS – COOKIES NOTICE.” section of Cookies and Other Technologies to learn more about our use of cookies and similar technologies with visitors from the EEA.</p>
                <h2>EU Visitors</h2>
                <p>If you are an EU citizen or UK citizen, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation or the UK-GDPR (collectively, the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below. For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers’ end users in connection with our provision of certain Services, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at : privacy@medialab.la.</p>
                <p>The legal bases for which we collect and use the information described above depends on what the information is and why we collected it. The four bases upon which we rely include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contract. This means we need the information to perform our contracted Services with you. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require that data.</li>
                    <li>Legitimate Interests. This means we have a legitimate interest that does not outweigh your privacy rights. When we collect and process information based on our legitimate interests, we consider how we can accomplish what we need to in a way that is the least obtrusive on your privacy. For example, it is in our interest to protect your safety and security in the Services, so we collect and use information that has been flagged by users or requested by law enforcement; to make sure you are satisfied with how the services work, troubleshoot technical problems or develop new features, we collect and use information about how you and others use the services and to respond to your service inquiries, we collect and use information in that request and, if relevant to the inquiry, information about how you access and use the services.</li>
                    <li>Legal Obligation. We may need to use your personal information to comply with a law enforcement preservation request, subpoena, or other legal process or to protect the rights of other users.</li>
                    <li>Consent. If we have no other legal basis for collecting or using your information, we will ask you for consent for a specific purpose. If we do, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not apply to any processing conducted in reliance on lawful processing bases other than consent.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>In addition to other rights detailed in the policy (such as requesting deletion, correction or updating of your personal information), EU and UK citizens have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Right to Object or Restrict Processing. You have the right to object to or restrict our use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes or under certain circumstances when the legal bases for using your information is based upon our legitimate interest. If you wish to object to our use of your information, you can send us a request to delete your account by sending an email to: privacy@medialab.la.</li>
                    <li>Right to Access or Erasure. You have the right to have your personal data erased and no longer processed. You also have the right to access the Personal Data we have collected about you. You can send us a request to delete your account or access your information by completing our Data Access & Erasure Form or by sending an email to: privacy@medialab.la. Upon receiving the request, we will make a reasonable effort to delete your personal information from the Service and from our internal network within a reasonable period of time as long as we are not obligated to preserve your information due to things like law enforcement preservation requests, subpoenas, investigations, litigation, or otherwise meet any of our other legal obligations. We may also retain depersonalized information after deletion.</li>
                    <li>Withdrawal of Consent. If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of the Services. You can exercise your right to withdraw consent by completing our by sending us an email to: privacy@medialab.la.</li>
                    <li>Data Portability. You can exercise your right to export your personal data by completing our Data Access & Erasure Form or by sending us an email to: privacy@medialab.la.</li>
                    <li>File a Complaint. You have the right to complain to the data protection authority located in your Member State. To find contact details, click here .</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As explained above, personal data collected in the EU or UK may be transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside of the EU and/or UK and processed by employees operating outside of the EU and/or UK who work for us, one of our business partners, or service providers. We have implemented sufficient GDPR compliant procedures to secure the transfer of your personal data to the United States. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States.</p>
                <h2>CHILDREN’S INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
                <p>Additionally, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 16 in countries subject to the EU GDPR, unless exempted by individual country exceptions.</p>
                <p>If you are under 13, or 16 where applicable, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the required minimum age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under the required minimum age may have provided us personal information, please contact us at: privacy@medialab.la.</p>
                <h2>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice to our Services and will update the notice’s effective date. We will give you an opportunity to review the changes before they go into effect. Your continued use of the Services following notice of the changes constitutes your acceptance of the changes, so we encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use our services. If you do not agree to the updated Privacy Policy, you may delete your account(s).</p>
